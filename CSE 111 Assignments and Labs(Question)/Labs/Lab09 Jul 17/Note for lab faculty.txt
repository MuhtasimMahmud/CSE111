Students need to learn the use of copy con <file_name.java> to create a .java file from the command prompt, 
and then compile and run the file from command prompt. Note that the %PATH% variable may need to be modified, 
i.e. the path of the bin folder under the JDK root folder needs to be added to the environment variable so 
that javac and java are accessible from the command prompt. Note that "echo %PATH%" can be used to see the 
current value of the PATH variable and "set PATH=%PATH%<path of jdk\bin>;" can be used to append the path 
of JDK\bin to the PATH variable. 
"javac <filename>.java" can be used to compile the file from the command prompt. 
"java <className>" can be used to execute the compiled class file from the command prompt.
